# Dynamoose Changelog

---

### Features

- Added support for enabling and configuring DynamoDB Streams through Table options

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `deep_copy` dropping sibling properties that share the same object reference (e.g. a single `Date` used for both `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, or a single address used for both `billingAddress` and `shippingAddress`). Circular reference detection now tracks only the current ancestor path rather than every object ever visited, which also removes an infinite-recursion risk on self-referencing arrays and a shared-reference leak on class instances containing circular properties
- Fixed the `expires` TTL attribute being silently dropped from every model registered against a table after the first. A model attaching to an already-constructed table did not receive the TTL attribute injection the `Table` constructor performs, so its writes stored no TTL attribute at all while DynamoDB continued to report `TimeToLiveStatus: ENABLED`. Affected every table shared by two or more distinct `Schema` objects, across `create`, `transaction.create`, and `update`
