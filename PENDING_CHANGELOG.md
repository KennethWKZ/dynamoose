# Dynamoose Changelog

---

### Features

- Added support for enabling and configuring DynamoDB Streams through Table options

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `deep_copy` dropping sibling properties that share the same object reference (e.g. a single `Date` used for both `createdAt` and `updatedAt`, or a single address used for both `billingAddress` and `shippingAddress`). Circular reference detection now tracks only the current ancestor path rather than every object ever visited, which also removes an infinite-recursion risk on self-referencing arrays and a shared-reference leak on class instances containing circular properties
- Fixed `queriedCount` always being `undefined` on `Model.query` results. The count of items DynamoDB read before applying filters was looked up on the response as `QueriedCount`, a property the DynamoDB API never returns; the `Query` operation reports it as `ScannedCount`, the same as `Scan`. This affected `query.exec`, `query.all`, and `query.count`, in both the array and `count()` response shapes
